# Hi there, I'm Riccardo üëã

## My work

Among my repos you can find many experiments, past projects and useful tools to improve my work that can help you too. I will summarize the main ones.

### üíª Server management, DevOps and CI/CD utilities.

An important part of my work involves managing systems, deploying web applications and automating frequent tasks, so Docker, containers and Linux are the basis of my knowledge.

Here you can find some useful resources and tools to speed up the work, as well as some interesting projects useful to understand in detail how computer systems work.

- [portainer-cli-deployer](https://github.com/riccardotornesello/portainer-cli-deployer): CLI tool to easily deploy a container stacks to Portainer. Built in Typescript.
- [os161-demand-paging](https://github.com/riccardotornesello/os161-demand-paging): university group project in which an os161-based operating system was created with demand paging and many optimizations

### üö© Cybersecurity and CTF (the hacking competitions)

A great passion of mine is cybersecurity, in fact I am a co-founder and former player with [r00tstici](https://github.com/r00tstici), an Italian CTF university team based at the University of Salento.

With this team I also got to organize CTFs, so here you can find CTFd plugins and writeups of old challenges.

- [CTFd-SSO-plugin](https://github.com/riccardotornesello/CTFd-SSO-plugin): authentication plugin using OAuth2 for CTFd. Written primarily in Python-Flask.
- [r00tstici writeups](https://github.com/r00tstici/writeups): writeup of old challenges that I helped solve along with the r00tstic team.
- [iac-cyberrange-generator](https://github.com/riccardotornesello/iac-cyberrange-generator): Python tool to create virtual cyberranges in cloud using infrastructure-as-cloud, created for my undergraduate thesis.

### üèéÔ∏è Sim-racing

I work with computers for passion but I am a professional simracer. Obviously I'm joking but simracing is a big passion of mine so over time I got into creating some tools or libraries for example to interface with games and extract telemetry from them.

- [irsdk-go](https://github.com/riccardotornesello/irsdk-go): porting of the official iRacing SDK from C++ to GoLang
- [motec-ld-go](https://github.com/riccardotornesello/motec-ld-go): Go library to write Motec LD telemetry files

### üß© Templates

- [Keil LandTiger LPC1768](https://github.com/riccardotornesello/Template-Keil-LandTiger-LPC1768): Keil uVision project template for the LandTiger board (LPC1768 ARM Cortex-M3) with basic functionalities (ASM and C)
